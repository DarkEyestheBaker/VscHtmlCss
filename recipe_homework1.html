        <h3>Directions</h3>
           

            <!-- Ordered list of directions below -->

                <!-- Note if you don't have special equipment. -->
                    <ul><em>If you don't have a hand or stand mixer, you can use a whisk, a wooden spoon, or anything you've got really.</em></ul>
                <li>While mixer is on, add eggs one at a time.</li>
                
                <!-- Alternate direction -->
                    <ul><em>Vanilla will be added if you included them with the eggs.  If not, add after eggs and mix.</em></ul>
                <li>Stir in flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt just until blended.</li>
                
                <!-- Caution -->

                <!-- I don't know your life!-->
                    <ul><em>Or 4.  It just depends on how you cut them and what your day's been like. </em>ü§ï</ul>
                    

            </ol>
