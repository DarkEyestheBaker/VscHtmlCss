                        <p>by Carla Martin </p>
                        <p>In 1670, Dorothy Jones and Jane Barnard each successfully petitioned the city of Boston ‚Äúto keepe a house of publique Entertainment for the sellinge of Coffee and Chucalettoe [sic].‚Äù  The record of their petitions is one of the earliest documentations of the presence of chocolate in the British American colonies. Like in Europe, chocolate at first met with mixed reactions; it was found to be so enjoyable that some of the more conservative members of society considered it sinful. This did not stop it from gaining popularity among the elite who could afford it, however, and consumption and gifting of chocolate was gradually accepted. </p>
